Frogger game
------------

In this game you have a Player and Enemies (Bugs). The goal of the player is to reach the water, without colliding into any one 
of the enemies. The player can move left, right, up and down. The enemies move in varying speeds on the paved block portion of 
the scene. Once a the player collides with an enemy, the game is reset and the player moves back to the start square. Once the 
player reaches the water the game is won.

To start the game, double click the index.html file. This will start up the game with the player in the lower center position
and the enemies/bugs racing across the screen.

Use the up, down, left, and right keys to move accordingly across the screen. You will not be allowed to move off of the screen.
Avoid the bugs and help the player get to the water tiles.

For the game to work, copy all files and folders to any location on your computer. The location is not important, only the relative
paths between the files is important.

There are no known bugs in this game code.
